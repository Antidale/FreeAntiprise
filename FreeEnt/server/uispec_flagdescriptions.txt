[@O]
You may add additional objectives to the game; they can be viewed in-game from the Track menu.

[Omode:classicforge]
Bring the Adamant and Legend Sword to Kokkol to complete this objective. In this mode, you will not receive the Excalibur from Kokkol; instead the Excalibur replaces the Crystal in the pool of key items. This mode forces the <em>Owin:crystal</em> flag to be on.

[Omode:classicgiant]
Defeat the Giant of Bab-il to complete this objective. In this mode, there is no character reward for finishing the Giant.

[Omode:fiends]
Defeat Milon, Milon Z., Kainazzo, Valvalis, Rubicant, and Elements to complete this mode.

[Omode:dkmatter]
45 Dark Matters are randomly placed in chests (MIABs excluded); bring 30 of them to Kory in Agart to complete this objective.

[Omode:external]
Use the EagleEye provided to you at the start of the game to complete this objective. This objective is intended for external objectives that cannot be referenced in-game, such as bingo goals or meta objectives.

[Orandom:tough_quest]
Refers only to the more difficult, later-game quest objectives.

[Owin:game]
Complete the required number of objectives to immediately win the game. Zeromus cannot be fought in this mode.

[Owin:crystal]
Complete the required number of objectives to get the Crystal, then defeat Zeromus to win the game.

[@Ocustom]
<ul>
    <li>Duplicate objectives will be omitted.</li>
    <li>A character objective is met when the requirements to gain the character have been fulfilled; you do not need to actually add them to your party.</li>
    <li>Starting characters do not count towards character objectives.</li>
    <li>Setting the Pass quest objective with no other P flags will force Pkey to be enabled.</li>
</ul>

[Kmain]
The locations of key items are shuffled amongst each other. For example, you may find the Magma Key in the Antlion's Nest instead of the Sandruby.

The items randomized this way are the <em>Package, SandRuby, Legend Sword, Baron Key, TwinHarp, Earth Crystal, Magma Key, Tower Key, Airship Hook, Luca Key, Dark Crystal, Pink Tail, Rat Tail, Pan, Spoon, Adamant,</em> and the <em>Crystal used to transform Zeromus</em> (yes, you have to find it.)

[Ksummon]
Key items may be awarded by the Sylphs, the king and queen of the Feymarch, Odin's throne, and Cave Bahamut.

[Kmoon]
Key items may be awarded by the bosses of the Lunar Subterrane.

[Kmiab:standard]
This excludes monster-in-a-box chests in the Lunar Subterrane, unless also using Kmoon or Kunsafe.

[Kmiab:all]
All monster-in-a-box chests are included, regardless of any Kmoon or Kunsafe settings.

[Kmiab:above]
Includes the monster-in-a-box chests in Zot, Castle Eblan, Cave Eblan, Upper Bab-il, the Giant of Bab-il, and the Lunar Path.

[Kmiab:below]
Includes the monster-in-a-box chests in Lower Bab-il, Sylph Cave, and the Feymarch.

[Kmiab:lst]
Includes the monster-in-a-box chests in the Lunar Subterrane. This setting ignores the Kmoon or Kunsafe safety check.

[Knofree]
Edward in Toroia will not give you a key item. Instead, a key item may be earned from Rydia's mom in Mist, who will appear after you have found and defeated the Mist Dragon.

[Kforce:magma]
You are guaranteed that there is a path to the underworld via the Magma Key, without needing to use the Hook route through Cave Eblan.

[Kforce:hook]
You are guaranteed that the Hook route through Cave Eblan is the only way to access the underworld.

[Kunsafe]
<ul>
    <li>Normally, you are guaranteed a path to the underworld that does not require first going to the moon. This flag removes that check.</li>
    <li>If Kmiab is enabled, key items may appear in the Lunar Subterrane monster-in-a-box chests.</li>
</ul>

[Kunweighted]
Normally, key-item-enabled locations outside of the <em>Kmain</em> checks are weighted against in terms of placement. This flag removes that weighting. 

[Pchests]
Passes are placed in three random treasure chests (not on the moon).

[Cstandard]
Characters join your party in the same locations as the original game, but the character you meet there is randomized. For example, you may encounter Yang in the Watery Pass instead of Tellah. The randomizer will try to prevent more powerful characters (Fusoya and Edge, by default) from appearing in early-game positions.

[Crelaxed]
Characters join your party in the same locations as the original game, but the character you meet there is randomized. For example, you may encounter Yang in the Watery Pass instead of Tellah. Unlike the standard randomization, characters are equally likely to appear in any position.

[Cnofree]
Characters will not join your party in the Watery Pass, Damcyan, Mysidia, or Mt. Ordeals.

[Cnoearned]
Characters will not join your party in Kaipo, Mt. Hobs, Baron, Zot, the Dwarf Castle, Cave Eblan, the Lunar Palace, or the Giant of Bab-il.

[Cmaybe]
Normally, the randomizer will try to include every eligible character in the game at least once. This flag removes that logic, meaning some eligible characters may not appear.

[@CrestrictDefine]
Under standard settings, the randomizer considers Fusoya and Edge to be "restricted" characters due to their power level, and will try to place them in later-game positions. You may redefine which characters are considered "restricted" here.

[@CstartDefine]
Your starting character will be chosen among the options selected here, regardless of other flag settings.

[@CstartModify]
Your starting character will be selected as normal according to your other flag settings, modified by the options selected here.

[Cj:spells]
White mages will learn Armor, Shell, and Dispel. All mages learn spells at the levels they would in FF4j.

[Cj:abilities]
Characters retain the battle commands from FF4j that were removed in FF4us.

[Cnodupes]
If a duplicate character tries to join your party, instead nothing happens.

[Cnekkie]
Characters start with a random low-level weapon and no armor. (Duplicate characters will have the same starting gear.)

[@Cthrifttier]
Characters start with a full set of gear: weapon(s), possibly a shield, and head/body/arms, all from at most the tier specified. (Duplicate characters will have the same starting gear. Cursed Rings are excluded.)

[Cbye]
Dismissed characters cannot be retrieved. (Normally, dismissed characters go to the Mysidia crystal room and the Tower of Wishes where they may be reclaimed.)

[Cpermajoin]
You have the choice of whether to accept each new party member, but once your party is full, you cannot recruit anyone else.

[Cpermadeath]
Party members that are "swoon" at the end of any battle are permanently removed from the game. (Does not apply to cutscene/story battles you are allowed to lose, ie. Dark Elf first round or Titan fight at Mist.)

[Cpermadeader]
Party members that are swoon or stone at the end of any battle are permanently removed from the game. (This includes the cutscene/story battles that you are normally allowed to lose; now you will game over if your party wipes during these battles.)

[Chero]
- The starting character is your hero.
- The hero is the only instance of that character available (unless other flags force it).
- The hero cannot be dismissed.
- The hero fights the Mt. Ordeals mirror room boss alone.
- Kokkol will craft an FF4 Advance weapon usable by the hero.
- The hero gains EXP even if incapacitated.
- The hero is your agility anchor.
- The hero is exempt from permadeath.

[Tshuffle]
Treasure contents are the same as in original FF4, but their positions are shuffled. This randomization is weighted so that overworld treasures tend to remain in the overworld, and similarly for underworld/moon treasures.

[Tstandard]
A basic randomization, allowing items of reasonable strength to appear. Items are equally likely to appear in any chest regardless of location.

[Tpro]
A skill-testing randomization, limiting the strength of available items, and weighted to favor stronger items in later-game and infrequently-visited areas.

[Twild]
An unrestricted randomization, allowing equal chance for items to appear in any chest, including the most powerful items.

[Twildish]
Allows items of any strength to appear, including the most powerful items, but uses location-based weighting like the pro randomization.

[Tplayable]
Equipment in chests will be usable by at least one character that you can acquire in the seed.

[Tjunk]
Normally, poor-quality items in chests are replaced with an equivalent amount of GP (based on sell price) to reduce inventory bloat. Enable this flag if you want to keep them as items.

[Tmoney]
Instead of their assigned contents, all chests contain an equivalent amount of GP, based on sell price (monster-in-a-box chests excluded).

[Sshuffle]
The same items are available for sale in shops as in original FF4, but their locations are shuffled. This randomization is weighted so that overworld shop items tend to remain on the overworld, and similarly for underworld/moon shops.

[Sstandard]
A basic randomization, allowing items of moderate strength to appear in shops, and weighted to place stronger items in later-game shops.

[Spro]
A skill-testing randomization, limiting the strength of available items, and weighted to place stronger items in shops gated behind key items.

[Swild]
An unrestricted randomization, allowing equal chance for items to appear in any shop, including the most powerful items.

[Sunsafe]
Normally, the randomizer guarantees Cure2 potions, Life potions and StarVeils are readily available, and that Cure3 potions are available in seeds without white mages. This flag removes those checks.

[Bstandard]
The positions of bosses are shuffled. Boss stats are roughly scaled to match the battle it's replacing. For example, Rubicant in the Watery Pass would have the HP and speed of Octomamm. (Yes, this flag is janky, and a MegaNuke is still a MegaNuke. Save often.)

[Bunsafe]
Normally, you are guaranteed a path to the underworld that does not require defeating the most difficult bosses. This flag removes that check.

[Bnofree]
All boss battle enemies have the "boss bit" set.  The alternate win conditions are removed from the D.Knight, Karate, K/Q.Eblan, and WaterHag fights.

[Balt:gauntlet]
Replaces the Fabul Gauntlet boss with five unscaled normal enemy encounters from the nearby area.

[Bwhichburn]
The replacement attack will be weaker than MegaNuke (unless <em>Bunsafe</em> is enabled, in which case it may not be).

[Bwoahdin]
The replacement attack will be single-target (and generally weaker than e.g. Nuke, unless <em>Bunsafe</em> is enabled). Odin will not raise the sword before the random attack.

[Bspellpower]
Normally in Free Enterprise, bosses without spell power do not gain spell power when moved into a spot that usually has spell power. This flag treats all bosses without spell power as having 1 spell power for the purposes of boss scaling.

[Bremove:officer_slot]
Normally in Free Enterprise, the Officer/Soldiers boss fight is included in the randomization. This flag removes the boss slot at Kaipo Inn entirely while keeping Officer/Soldiers in the pool.

[Bremove:kingqueen_slot]
Normally in Free Enterprise, the KQ Eblan boss fight is included in the randomization, with invented stats at the Hook 1 slot based off the second part of the vanilla Lugae boss fight. This flag removes that boss slot entirely while keeping KQ Eblan in the pool.

[@G]
The glitches explicitly referenced here are <em>disabled by default</em>; setting these flags enables them to act as they do in original FF4. Glitches not mentioned here remain intact and available.

[Gsylph]
When enabled, casting Sylph will only deduct MP from the caster if they are in the middle party slot.

[Etoggle]
Encounters can be enabled/disabled from the in-game Custom menu.

[Ekeep:doors]
Prevents the above encounter rate setting from applying to the TrapDoor fights in the Sealed Cave.

[Ekeep:behemoths]
Prevents the above encounter rate setting from applying to the forced Behemoth fights in Cave Bahamut.

[Edanger]
Back attacks and "Surprised!" encounters will still occur, even when encounters are disabled via <em>Etoggle</em> or <em>Enoencounters</em>.

[Enoexp]
Bosses and monster-in-a-box fights still award EXP.

[Enomacgiant]
The MacGiant in the Searcher encounter is replaced by a Machine.

[-kit3:99]
99 of a random item.

[-kit3:green]
A grab bag of items selected individually by FE devs without any coordination whatsoever.

[-kit3:atb]
2-3 SilkWebs, 4-5 Hermes, 1 HrGlass1, and 3-4 Heal potions.

[-kit3:random]
One of the other kit options, selected at random.

[-noadamants]
Adamant Armors are not available. Trading the Pink Tail in the Adamant Grotto instead grants a strong item.

[-monsterevade]
Monsters will be able to evade both physical and magical attacks from your party based on their actual stats. (This change constitutes a significant damage reduction for many fights!)

[-monsterflee]
Monsters will be able to flee from battles that you can run from, based on their evasion stat. Requires <em>-monsterevade</em> to be active.

[@smithy]
Normally, Kokkol the Smith forges the Adamant and Legend to make Excalibur. These flags change what Kokkol will make.

[-smith:super]
Instead of the Excalibur, Kokkol the Smith will forge a weapon from Final Fantasy 4 Advance. (Some weapons have been modified slightly due to technical limitations.)

[-smith:playable]
The item that Kokkol forges will be usable by a character you can acquire in the seed.

[@fusoya] 
By default, Free Enterprise runs with the "FuSoYa Challenge", where FuSoYa begins with 500 HP and a collection of low-level spells, and each boss defeated grants him 100 HP and three random additional spells. This behaviour may be changed using these flags.

[-fusoya:vanilla] 
Restore the vanilla game's FuSoYa behaviour, where he joins with 1900 HP and his full spellset.

[-fusoya:sequential_p] 
Instead of learning spells randomly, FuSoYa will learn spells in order based on the levels at which Palom and Porom learn their spells.

[-fusoya:sequential_r] 
Instead of learning spells randomly, FuSoYa will learn spells in order based on the levels at which Rydia and Rosa learn their spells. He will not learn spells learned outside of level-ups (Fire1, Fire2/Ice2/Lit2, Exit).

[-fusoya:location] 
FuSoYa will learn three spells after every boss, but the spells learned depend on the boss location. Stronger/gated boss spots are weighted to provide more powerful spells.

[-fusoya:nerfed] 
FuSoYa will start with a fixed pool of 14 black magic and 14 white magic spells (17 with j-spells), mostly tier 2 and below, but will not learn any spells over the course of the game. He will still gain HP as usual.

[-fusoya:maybe] 
Normally, FuSoYa will eventually learn all possible spells. This flag removes that guarantee; each possible spell will be included independently with an 85% chance.

[@agility]
FF4 scales the speed of combat based on the agility stat of your party's "agility anchor". In Free Enterprise, the anchor is always the first occupied party slot (in the sequence of middle, top, bottom, top-middle, bottom-middle). Under these flags, the ATB system will change, either by choosing a different anchor or by using a different formula for calculating the speed of combat (in a few different ways). 

Note that any of these flags except for scaling the base ATB and changing the speed modifier will override the <em>Chero</em> agility effect, if playing with the hero challenge.

[-agility:vanilla]
In vanilla FF4, if Cecil is in the party, then he is the agility anchor, regardless of position. Enabling this flag will restore that behavior, making the first Cecil in your party the anchor, if present. 

[-agility:fastest]
This flag will double the Count timer.

[-agility:average]
Under this flag, the (truncated) average of your party's agility values is used as the anchoring value, even if none of your characters have exactly that agility.

[-agility:monster]
Under this flag, the (truncated) average of the monster formation's agility values is used as the anchoring value. Note that some monsters are incredibly fast, so your party will be very slow. This flag will triple the Count timer.

[-agility:flat]
Under this flag, every character and monster will have the same base ATB (5 ticks, unless scaled).

[-agility:750formula]
Under this flag, every character and monster will have their base ATB calculated as (15 * 10 * scale) / (Agility + 32), where the scale parameter is 5 by default (unless scaled, below). This flag will triple the Count timer.

[@anchor]
Under these flags, all agility anchoring will be based on the given fixed value, even if none of your characters have that agility. For 27 or 28 Agility anchoring, the Count timer will be doubled. For 41 or 42 Agility anchoring, the Count timer will be tripled.

[@agilityscale]
The default base ATB for the agility anchor is 5 ticks. Under these flags, the base ATB can be scaled down to 1 tick or up to 10 ticks. Under the 10 tick scaling, the Count timer will be doubled.

[-speedmodbalance]
In vanilla FF4, the speed modifier is a number from 12 to 32 that, when divided by 16, gives a fraction by which character timers are scaled (to speed up or slow down your characters and their charge times). Under this flag, the speed modifier now goes from 8 to 32, Slow only adds 4 instead of 8, Fast subtracts 4 instead of 3, and SilkWebs only add 8 instead of 16 (Hermes were already subtracting 8).

[@exp]
To reduce grinding, Free Enterprise normally applies a number of experience boosts, which may be individually disabled by these flags. There are also options to change the experience distribution in other ways.

[-exp:split]
Normally in Free Enterprise, earned EXP is not divided among the party, and each member receives the full amount. Set this flag to restore the original FF4 EXP distribution scheme (ie. earned EXP is divided among the surviving party members).

[-exp:noboost]
Normally in Free Enterprise, in a full party, low-level party members (at least 5 levels below the median level) earn double EXP. Set this flag to remove this bonus.

[-exp:nokeybonus]
By default in Free Enterprise, once 10 key items have been collected, earned EXP is doubled. Set this flag to remove this bonus.

[-exp:crystalbonus]
Under this flag, characters earn double EXP once you obtain the Crystal.

[@objectiveexp]
Normally, objectives do not increase the amount of EXP received from battles. Under this flag, each completed objective earns you more EXP from each battle.

[-exp:objectivebonus_num]
The EXP bonus is 100% divided by the number of available objectives in the seed; e.g. with 7 objectives, each objective gives you about 14% extra EXP (subject to some truncation).

[@kicheckexp]
Normally, completing key item checks does not increase the amount of EXP received from battles. Under this flag, each completed key item check beyond the starting item earns you more EXP from each battle.

[-exp:kicheckbonus_num]
The EXP bonus is 100% divided by the number of potential key item checks in the seed; e.g. with the 21 non-starting main and summon checks on, each objective gives you about 4.7% extra EXP (subject to some truncation).

[@zonkbonusexp]
Normally, the rewards from key item checks do not impact the amount of EXP received from battles. Under this flag, every time you get a non-key-item reward from a potential key item check (a "zonk") you earn more EXP from future battles.

[@miabbonusexp]
Normally, MIAB encounters have the same EXP calculation as other encounters. Under this flag, MIAB encounters award double or 1.5 times the usual EXP.

[@moonbonusexp]
Normally, location of encounter does not increase EXP. Under this flag, encounters on the moon award double or triple the usual EXP.

[-exp:maxlevelbonus]
Normally, level does not play into EXP calculations. Under this flag, if 5 plus twice the largest level in your party is less than the smallest monster level in the encounter, then the encounter awards 20% bonus EXP (and another 20% for each additional deficit of 5).

[@geometricexp]
Normally in FF4, each instance of a monster type killed in battle gives the same amount of EXP. Under this flag, each monster of the same type defeated in the same battle will yield a scaled amount of the EXP of the previous monster of that type, giving diminishing returns for repeated monster kills. Note that the reduction is per monster type and not "per slot" in battle.

[-vanilla:hobs]
By default, instead of learning Fire1 at Mt. Hobs, Rydia will learn a random summon (other than Leviatan and Bahamut). This flag removes that behavior.

[-vanilla:growup]
By default in Free Enterprise, the summons learned when Rydia ages are randomized. Set this flag to return to the vanilla summons learned at that time (Mist, Indra, Jinn, Shiva, and Titan).

[-vanilla:fashion]
To help distinguish duplicate characters, Free Enterprise randomizes the battle palettes of each character. Enabling this flag preserves each character's original battle colors.

[-vanilla:miabs]
By default, monster-in-a-box chests are relocated randomly within the same dungeon/area. This flag forces MIABs to remain in their original positions.

[-vanilla:giant]
Removes the added exit at the start of the Giant of Bab-il, forcing you to complete it in order to return to the Big Whale. (Be careful not to get stuck with your only save file being inside the Giant.) This exit is restored once the Giant is completed.

[-z:physical]
Enable this flag to replace Zeromus' magic-based damaging attacks with physical attacks (Fight, Dark Wave, Needle/Counter). Zeromus now counters some physical commands instead of magic.

[-z:physmag]
In half the seeds rolled with this flag, Zeromus will have the physical script from <em>-z:physical</em>, and in the other half Zeromus will have the usual magic script.

[-z:whichbang]
Each instance of Big Bang is replaced with a (potentially different) spell chosen from a small list, including Big Bang itself.

[-z:phaseshift]
Zeromus has three main phases after the first Big Bang: Virus, Nuke, and Meteo. Enable this flag to shuffle the three attack phases among themselves (the HP thresholds and reactions will not change).

[-z:nonerfs]
Normally in FF4, Zeromus' Big Bang can be nerfed by using magic to trigger a counter-Nuke between the tick that Z sets spell power for Big Bang and the tick when Big Bang goes off. Enable this flag to prevent that happening by implementing chains.

[-z:mustnerf]
Zeromus will now do 9999 damage with Big Bang unless you nerf it (or avoid it in other ways).

[-z:vanillasprite]
Free Enterprise replaces Zeromus' battle sprite with a random sprite. (Its battle behavior and stats are unchanged.) Enable this flag to preserve Zeromus' original battle sprite.

[-vintage]
Enables the April Fools Day 2019 mode.

[-pushbtojump]
<ul>
    <li>Enables the April Fools Day 2020 mode.</li>
    <li>This flag does not affect the randomized placement of progression items.</li>
    <li>Stability is absolutely not guaranteed.</li>
    <li>Instability is absolutely guaranteed.</li>
    <li>(If a door goes somewhere you don't expect it to go, it was probably a "return" door, which takes you back to your previous location.)</li>
</ul>

[@wacky]
<ul>
    <li>Guidingway will introduce the challenge.</li>
    <li>Guidingway will not explain the challenge.</li>
    <li>Wacky challenges are not intended to be balanced, robust, coherent, fair, or bug-free.</li>
    <li>(They are intended to be wacky.)</li>
</ul>

[-tweak:kainmagic] 
Kain gets two spellsets: White (with a new spell Lance replacing Sight) and Black. (Yes, Lance is overpowered when other characters use it. Enjoy your 1200 strats!)

[-tweak:edwardheal]
