# FreeEnterprise4

This is the open-source version of Free Enterprise 4.x. It contains the full functionality of Free Enterprise 4.x, with some omissions:

- The Z sprite and harp songs databases are not included, though the tools to generate assets in the correct format are.

- The dwarf job list is omitted; should you wish to create your own, this is a simple text file with one job per line.

- Passwords, encryption keys, and similar secrets used in the public deployment of Free Enterprise have been excluded.

Basic setup instructions are included here; for a more detailed guide, visit https://wiki.ff4fe.com/doku.php?id=dev:setup_guide

### Contributors

Free Enterprise was made possible using the extensive technical research and knowledge of PinkPuff, Grimoire LD, Chillyfeez, and Aexoden. This repo contains code written and designed by b0ardface/HungryTenor, Crow, Myself086, Myria, mxzv, and Wylem. It also contains the graphic design work of SchalaKitty and Steph Sybydlo. It is based on the game design work of riversmccown and mxzv. And while their specific assets are not included in this repo, the musical work of Xenocat and Calmlamity contributes extensively to Free Enterprise, and was formative in the development of tools contained here.


Thanks to the following people specifically for my branch:
Sgrunt and Wylem for numerous flag additions and multi wacky
ScytheMarshall and Galeswift for Exp modification flags 
Antidale for song and Z sprites
